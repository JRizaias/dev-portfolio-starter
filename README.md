# Dev Portfolio Template

I created this clean and modern website template to help tech professionals — including developers, data analysts, data scientists, and other tech enthusiasts — showcase their projects, writeups, and experiences in a simple and effective way.

## ✨ Purpose

The main goal is to provide a **fully static solution**, requiring **no backend or external database**, built only with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, so that anyone can:

- Highlight key **personal or professional projects**
- Publish **articles, guides, or technical reflections**
- Display tools and technologies used per project
- Manage all content using simple JSON files
- Have a responsive and clean layout that works across devices

## 🎯 Target Audience

This template is perfect for:
- Beginner to experienced developers
- Data professionals (data scientists, engineers, analysts)
- Anyone in tech looking to create a personal portfolio or profile

## 🚀 Key Features

- Fixed **top navigation bar**
- Collapsible **sidebar** with contextual info
- Dynamic **project and article sections** rendered from JSON
- Fully **responsive** and mobile-friendly
- Built without external frameworks, so you can easily tweak or extend it as you need

## 💡 Use Cases

You can use this template to:
- Build your online resume or personal portfolio
- Organize and share public files (e.g. whitepapers, guides)
- Centralize links to your blog, newsletter, and professional profiles

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- Modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- No frameworks, no build tools required

## 📁 Data Structure
